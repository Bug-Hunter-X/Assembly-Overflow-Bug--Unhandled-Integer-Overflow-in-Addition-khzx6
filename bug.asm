```assembly
mov ax, 1000h ; Load a large value into AX
add ax, bx    ; Add the contents of BX to AX
```
This code snippet is problematic if the value in `BX` is large enough that adding it to `AX` causes an overflow.  In 16-bit assembly, `AX` can only hold values up to 65535 (0xFFFF).  If the sum exceeds this limit, an overflow occurs, resulting in unexpected behavior.  The overflow might wrap around (producing an incorrect smaller value) or cause an exception (depending on the specific CPU and operating system settings).
